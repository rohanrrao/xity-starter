An online scrapbook for logs and essays on my **climbing adventures and outdoor experiences** in general, with frequent effusions on **veganism, minimalism and sustainable living** and the importance of **slowing down**.

### Work

Current location: Vancouver, BC; dreaming of Squamish.

A digital marketing and product management generalist currently working for Western Union Business Solutions to help improve their marketing technology stack and processes. <br /><br /><br />

### Outdoors

I am an serious outdoor enthusiast and an avid climber. I enjoy all disciplines of <ins>[climbing](blog/tag/climbing/)</ins> - bouldering, sport, trad and alpine style. I am not a pro by any mean, but neither am I a noob in most climbing styles, except for pure waterfall ice. As far as <del>mixed climbing</del> goes, I am yet to try it. <br /><br /><br />

### Photography

I am also an <ins>[photography](blog/tag/photography/)</ins> enthusiast, mostly inspired by wilderness landscapes <ins>[landscape](blog/tag/landscape/)</ins> and <ins>[street](blog/tag/street/)</ins> photography genres.

Having said that, I do realize that these two photographic choices sit at the opposite end of the spectrum - with landscape photography being slow, calibrated and an artistic pursuit placing extreme importance on the aethetics of the frame, street photography on the other hand is more a snapshot style and impromptu art focusing less on the aesthetics of the frame and more on the story behind it, much similar to any documentary pursuits.

I am also interested in timelapse, but the amount of time and efforts it takes to edit <ins>[timelapse](blog/tag/timelapse/)</ins> behind the computer is not worth the opportunity cost of of climbing or just being outside for me personally. <br /><br /><br />

### Drawing videos

Recently, although I am not the principal artist behind this one, I have started supporting my wife's YouTube channel, <ins>[The Art Zombie](https://youtube.com/theartzombie)</ins>`(external YouTube link)`. Her channel features timelapsed/fast-forwarded videos of her drawings - mostly portraits and occasionally some mandalas every now and then. Now these really are wonderful drawings in my opinion and I wish I could be that good.
